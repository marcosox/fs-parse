# BGL file specification errata

These are the differences I found between actual BGL files found in the wild
and the specification found at https://www.fsdeveloper.com/wiki/index.php/BGL_File_Format

Some information have been found with the help of the Prepar3d spec
at http://www.prepar3d.com/SDK/Environment%20Kit/BGL%20Compiler%20SDK/Compiling%20BGL.html

### BGL header

- filetime value can also be nanoseconds since epoch (1970)

### All SceneryObject records

- the FSX types have an additional UUID value after the "unknown"

### Generic building records

- 0x01 is the ID for FS9 types

### Effect placement records

- 0x0d is the ID for FSX effects, 0x04 (not present in the spec) is for fs9 effects
- the effect parameters string is zero terminated **without** being aligned to the next word (2 bytes) boundary

### Beacon records

- there are two types of beacons
    - FS9 types have ID 0x08
    - FSX types have ID 0x11

### Trigger records

- records with 0x07 type id are probably FS9 triggers

### Attached Object records

- FS9 types have start id = 0x10 and end id = 0x1001
- FS9 types don't have the instance id field
- the record is not counted in the subsection records_count as a separate record.
